        studyBrief: "Countries trade because no single nation can produce everything efficiently. The key concept is comparative advantage — a country should specialize in what it produces most efficiently relative to others, then trade for the rest. This creates mutual gains even if one country is better at producing everything. Trade creates a surplus of cheaper imported goods for consumers, but can hurt domestic industries. A trade surplus means you export more than you import; a trade deficit means the opposite.",

Progressive tax systems charge higher rates as income rises — the US uses tax 'brackets' where only income above each threshold is taxed at the higher rate. A flat tax charges the same percentage to everyone. Sales taxes are regressive — they take a bigger share of income from poorer people who spend proportionally more.",

        studyBrief: "A mortgage is a loan using the property itself as collateral. Most buyers put down 10-20% and borrow the rest. This is leverage — using borrowed money to control a larger asset. Leverage amplifies both gains AND losses: if you put 20% down on a $500K home and it rises 10% to $550K, your return on your $100K investment is actually 50%. But if it drops 10%, your $100K is wiped out. Amortization is the process of gradually paying off the loan — early payments are mostly interest, later payments chip away at the principal (actual loan amount).",
